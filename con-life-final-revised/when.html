    <h2>Oh, the Places You'll Go...</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, before con-life, I was a total homebody! I only went traveling to places where I had family, which was for the most part, to the Bronx or Yonkers in New York, and I hardly ever made any big travel plans by myself.
However, seeing as how not many conventions happen to appear in Little Rock, I had to find my happy places elsewhere. <p>The first convention I traveled to, completely on my own, was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I’d been there before, but never on my own. 
On top of that, I’m a single mama, so funds were scarce after an airline flight. So, I reached out to the social media volunteer group I was in and asked if anyone was looking for a roommate for the weekend.</p><p>Thus, I ended up sharing a one-queen-bed hotel room with three strangers, who, funny enough, became some of my best friends in real life!</p>

  <h2>Okay, but When Already??</h2>
  
  <p> When I first started working conventions, it was for one specific traveling convention and there were few and far other conventions in-between. The wait between cons was excrutiating!</p>
  <p>Now, there's a convention almost every single weekend, going on in different parts of the country, if not the world, all at once. For example, as I write this, Johnny Depp is departing from Tokyo, Japan, after appearing at his first Comic Convention signing, all while there were no less than five other huge comic conventions occurring across the U.S this past weekend.<span class="sup"><sup>(12/8/25)</sup></span></p>

 <h3>Which Con to Work, Though???</h3>

  <blockquote>Now, since I don't know what your brand of nerd-dom is, I've gathered the most popular convention websites with calendars for future pop, horror, and anime conventions within the next year or two, below. Take a look around at all the different conventions to see which you'd like to be a part of!</cite></blockquote>

      <p>Oh boy! What can I say about Pop Culture Cons, but whew! So much fun! And full of ALL genres of talent appearances. I've worked for directors, live-action actors, wrestling personalities, video game & anime voice actors at a pop con. Everything is covered here!</p>

      <p>This genre is definitely not for the faint of heart! Monsters lurk around every corner in the form of super creative Cosplays. Your scariest characters are actually super cool humans who love to meet their fans! Pinhead, Jason, & Freddy? The horror scares are real!</p>

      <p>Anime Cons. They are some of the most fun you'll have, and I have never even seen one anime series! I've worked several times for several anime voice actors, and familiarized myself with their characters. Oh. And the Cosplays? Top Notch! The best I've seen at any con!</p>
