  <blockquote>"We all want to have the fanciest webpages out there, but we also want our content to be front and center, otherwise, there’s no point in the website."<cite>From Chrissy's Take on Progressive Enhancement by Chrissy Jones.</cite></blockquote>

  <h3>Chrissy's Take</h3>
 

  <p>Progressive Enhancement can be described a lot like baking. You must prepare the main ingredients to go into the oven (the content), then you have to bake the ingredients together to make them into one, cohesive document… ummm…. I mean cake (CSS), and then finally, you can add all the fun decorations and features you want to make it unique and attractive to all (JS).</p> 
<p>A long, long time ago, developers believed that graceful degradation web development (basically setting a website up for technical failure) was really the way to go. Instead of focusing on the content and structure of the site, they were more concerned about what wouldn’t work (feature-wise) across all web browsers. So, in effect, they built their sites according to the features they wanted and would work for most browsers, with caveats in the code for those users who used browsers that were not compatible with those features.</p>
<p>Now, luckily, developers utilize Progressive Enhancement, which focuses on the content first, accessibility second, and features third. This ensures that the most important part of the website, the content, is accessible to all users, despite their browser. Some CSS is unnecessary and JavaScript is the afterthought.</p>
<p>We all want to have the fanciest webpages out there, but we also want our content to be front and center, otherwise, there’s no point in the website. We want to use plain language to ensure that the content is understood the way it is meant to be understood the first time a user reads it. And yes, the CSS can be important, too, enabling us to group the information in bundles that make it easier to understand and find. The JavaScript is the least important on a website, because not all browsers or users allow it to run.</p>
<p>I enjoy designing a website from the ground up, really thinking about the content that is most important to get out, and then thinking about how I will present it. The features, for me, come last, anyway. My thoughts are more about, “wouldn’t it be cool if this section did this,” after I’m done writing and designing.</p>
<p>So, I believe this method of building websites is definitely the most common sense.</p>

  <h3>Building The Con-Life</h3>
  

  <p>I have to say. This was probably one of my toughest projects to date. And I have a master’s degree. It wasn’t difficult in terms of what I had already learned throughout the semester, but the things I hadn’t learned yet are what threw me off the most. My biggest thank you’ s go out to W3Schools and Google AI for helping me with the coding I was unfamiliar with, mostly how to get JavaScript to implement properly. I think the handiest lesson I learned, overall, throughout this project was how to modify existing code to integrate with my own, creating the effects I wanted to present.</p>
<p>I am so proud of everything I have learned throughout the semester, though. I came in barely understanding HTML5, and now I can write a lot of it on my own. I’ve been able to use the lessons I’ve learned in class and apply them to real-life situations on the websites I manage for both UA Little Rock and Just Communities of Arkansas. At the beginning of this project, I was hesitant because I wasn’t sure if I could create the site I was hoping to, but with the tools I’ve gathered from class, I think I created exactly what I wanted to.</p>
<p>For this project, I wanted it to have a comic book feel, ergo the background, the colors, and the font. I wanted it to be a bright and fun site that encourages those hoping to join the convention community to feel as if it’s the place they want to be. The book on the How page is probably my favorite feature of the site. This is a graphic design project I created while I was in Graduate School, and I had no idea then it would integrate so well into this project.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the book was a complete afterthought to be a place filler. I didn’t realize I could embed the link for the book until I investigated the page for it and found the embed code. I’m just happy that it fits so well with the rest of the site! I’m also proud of all my images, as I modified all the personal photos with captions, and created my own backgrounds and maps.</p>
<p>If I could go back and do things over, I might make my photos clickable so that they revealed the stats of the actors featured in the slideshow. I really wanted to keep the slideshow but was unable to modify any HTML/CSS combos to make it work, so I settled for the photos, alone.  I also would have liked to create an animated feature that made the images not in the slideshow (the maps, application images) enlarge on click. I did try this trick, but no matter how I untangled the code and CSS, I couldn’t get it to work correctly. The JavaScript was just not with me.</p>
<p>The only recommendation I received, and I had several folks take a look, was that the text was a little hard to read in some spots. Because it was an easy revision, I went ahead and changed the font to be bigger and bold, which I think adds to the comic book aesthetic. I also didn’t realize until now that I forgot to place an email address somewhere in the site, but my contact form does come directly to my email, so that’s almost the same, right?</p>
